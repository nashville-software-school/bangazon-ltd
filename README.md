## Bangazon API

Once you have been assigned to your team, the entire team will build the initial version of the Bangazon Application Programming Interface. This API will be used by much of the rest of the platform, and by our customers to buy & sell products. You will use all of the Magical Abstractions and conventions that the development ecosystem provides to build the API.

As you build subsequent projects, you will learn much of the foundational technologies, tools and concepts that the Magical Abstrations do for you.
